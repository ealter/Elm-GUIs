<h1>Menus in Elm</h1>
<h2>By Eliot Alter and Max Goldstein</h2>

<p>For our final project in Comp150-FP, we co-wrote a paper on our attempt to
create desktop-style menus in Elm. It outlines the challenges posed and the
solutions we found. Primarily, we were able to detect hover information about
the elements in a Signal Element without modifying the compiler or runtime, but
in a way that is very non-obvious (hopefully). It is a workaround for the lack
of signals of signals. Any sufficiently advanced GUI using Graphics.Input will
be affected by the problems we outline. We also include an overview of Elm
targeted for those with a background in FP, with particular attention paid to
explaining why signals of signals are disallowed. We also briefly analyze
TodoFRP as the current state-of-the-art in Elm GUIs, and the HTML widget
wrappers in Graphics.Input. You can read our paper
<a href="PAPER.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>We also provided several demos highlighting various functionality of our menu
system. The source code for each example can be found in our
<a href="https://github.com/ealter/Elm-GUIs">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="demo/menus/main.html">main.elm</a> is a standard menus with a
    few nested directories.</li>

    <li><a href="demo/menus/dynamic.html">dynamic.elm</a> shows off a menu with
    non-constant strings. Certain parts of the menu change on keyboard strokes
    and mouse clicks.</li>

    <li><a href="demo/menus/indexes.html">indexes.elm</a> looks just like
    <a href="demo/menus/main.html">main.elm</a> except it tests the
    <code>stringsAgain</code> and <code>treeAtPath</code> functions.</li>

    <li><a href="demo/menus/maybeBlank.html">maybeBlank.elm</a> tests how the
    code handles blank strings. It demonstrates a bug in the hoverable detection
    of Elm. Put your mouse in the middle of the first menu item and wait for the
    menu to change. After the menu changes, the mouse stops hovering over the
    first item, but the first submenu remains expanded.</li>

    detection.</li>
